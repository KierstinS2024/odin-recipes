    <h2>About this lasagna</h2>
    <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how
        successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
        than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two
        decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.</p>
    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!

        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 lb mozzarella cheese, <em>sliced</em></li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 TBS parsley, basil, 1
            tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hrs, stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly saled water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8-10 minutes.
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 TBS parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3
            of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 Â½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
            Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
