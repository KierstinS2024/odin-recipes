    <h2>What is Wonton Soup?</h2>
    <p>Wonton soup is a Chinese soup featuring savory, cooked wontons in a clear broth, often with added noodles or
        vegetables. The wontons themselves are small dumplings filled with ingredients like pork and shrimp, which are
        then boiled and added to the broth. The soup is typically characterized by its mild, yet flavorful broth and the
        delicate texture of the wontons.
