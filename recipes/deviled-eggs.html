    <h2>About these eggs</h2>
    <p>An absolute crowd-favorite appetizer! Easy to make and can be prepped ahead of time. Perfect for the holidays!
    </p>
    <p>Deviled eggs is a classic appetizer that consists of hard boiled eggs that are peeled and cut in half. The yolks
        are removed and typically mixed with mayonnaise, mustard, sweet pickle relish, salt and pepper. The egg white
        halves are then refilled with this velvety filling, garnished with paprika. The term “deviled” is in reference
        to highly seasoned foods with heat and spice such as the paprika garnish on top.</p>
